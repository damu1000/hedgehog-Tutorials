## Tutorials
Detailed explanations about the tutorials can be found in this [website](). 

## Dependencies
- All tutorials depends on the [Hedgehog](https://github.com/usnistgov/hedgehog) library, location is specified by using: 
``` cmake
cmake -DHedgehog_INCLUDE_DIR=<dir>
```
The tutorials presented here need to be compiled with a C++ compiler compatible with C++17 with the standard filesystem library accessible. 

Tested Compilers and Debuggers:
- Linux
  + g++ 8.3.0
  + GDB 8.3
- Windows: 
  + cl.exe 19.23 (MSVC 14.23.28105)
  + GDB 8.30
- macOS 10.15
  + g++ 8.3.0
  + GDB 8.0.1
  + LLDB 7.0.1
  
For a custom GDB, [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) supports version 7.8.x-8.3.x

Libraries/tools:
- cmake 3.12+ is recommended for building the tutorials.
- Tutorial 3 requires [OpenBlas](http://www.openblas.net/).
- Tutorial 4 requires [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone).

[TCLAP](http://tclap.sourceforge.net/) is used and is embedded in the repository to parse the command-line of the
 different tutorials. 

## Getting started
```
1) From the hedgehog-Tutorials directory, create a build directory
2) From the build directory run, 'cmake -DHedgehog_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/hedgehog ../'
3) Run 'make'
```

The firsts tutorial are meant to demonstrate the usage of Hedgehog's API, and are not representative of gaining performance.
