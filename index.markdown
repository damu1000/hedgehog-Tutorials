# Dependencies
- All tutorials depends on the [Hedgehog](https://github.com/usnistgov/hedgehog) library, location is specified using: 
{% highlight cmake %}
cmake -DHedgehog_INCLUDE_DIR=<dir>
{% endhighlight %}

- Tutorial 3 requires <a href="http://www.openblas.net/" rel="external">OpenBLAS </a>
- Tutorial 4 and 5 require <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone" rel="external">CUDA </a>.

<a href="http://tclap.sourceforge.net/" rel="external">TCLAP</a> is used and is embedded in the repository to parse the command of the
 different tutorials.

# Getting started
The tutorials presented here need to be compiled with a C++ compiler that is compatible with C++17 and has the standard filesystem library accessible. 

Tested Compilers and Debuggers:
- Linux
  + g++ 8.3.0
- Windows
  + cl.exe 19.23 (MSVC 14.23.28105)
- macOS 10.15
  + g++ 8.3.0

To use the Hedgehog API include the following header file:
```
#include <hedgehog/hedgehog.h>
```
# Tutorial contents
- [Tutorial 1 - Graph and Task: Simple Hadamard product](tutorials/tutorial1.html)
- [Tutorial 2 - Multiple inputs, State, State Manager: Hadamard product](tutorials/tutorial2.html)
- [Tutorial 3 - Cycle resolution: CPU Matrix Multiplication](tutorials/tutorial3.html)
- [Tutorial 4 - GPU Computation and memory management: GPU Matrix Multiplication](tutorials/tutorial4.html)
- [Tutorial 5 - MultiGPU Computation and graph bunble: GPU Matrix Multiplication](tutorials/tutorial5.html)

The first tutorials are meant to demonstrate the usage of the Hedgehog API, and are not meant for obtaining performance.
